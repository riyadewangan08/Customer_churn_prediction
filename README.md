![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d871cd9-a346-4fac-a212-132cecf7da61)

## 📁 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various classification algorithms. We analyze behavioral and demographic features of customers and apply supervised machine learning models to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encode categorical variables
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models
- Identify key drivers behind churn using feature importance
- Compare model performance with visualizations

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset includes the following key features:

- `Tenure`
- `PreferredLoginDevice`
- `CityTier`
- `WarehouseToHome`
- `CashbackAmount`
- `Complain`, `SatisfactionScore`, `NumberOfAddress`, etc.
- `Churn` (Target variable)

## 📌 Key Findings

🔸 Tenure: The most significant predictor of churn. Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to leave, indicating the importance of onboarding and early retention strategies.

🔸 CashbackAmount: Customers who received higher cashback amounts tend to stay longer. Offering attractive incentives and personalized deals could reduce churn.

🔸 WarehouseToHome Distance: Longer delivery distances negatively impact customer satisfaction and increase the chance of churn. Optimizing logistics and reducing delivery time may improve loyalty.

🔸 Complaints and SatisfactionScore: Customers who frequently raise complaints or have low satisfaction scores are more likely to churn. Improving customer service and resolving issues quickly is critical.

🔸 Device and Platform Preferences: Customers using certain login devices or preferred order categories showed different churn behaviors, which can help in segment-specific marketing.

🔸 Model Comparison:

Random Forest outperformed all other models in both accuracy and feature interpretation.

Decision Tree performed well but was slightly less accurate and prone to overfitting.

Logistic Regression showed decent baseline performance but lacked flexibility in capturing nonlinear relationships.

## 📝 Conclusion
🔍 Built a complete Customer Churn Prediction system using supervised machine learning techniques.

🎯 Objective: To predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their behavioral and transactional data.

🧹 Performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.

🧠 Applied and compared multiple classification models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

🥇 Among all models, Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 96.36%.

📊 Conducted feature importance analysis to identify key factors affecting churn, which helps businesses target at-risk customers effectively.

💼 This model can assist marketing and CRM teams in implementing proactive retention strategies, reducing customer loss and improving revenue.
