![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d871cd9-a346-4fac-a212-132cecf7da61)

## 📁 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various classification algorithms. We analyze behavioral and demographic features of customers and apply supervised machine learning models to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encode categorical variables
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models
- Identify key drivers behind churn using feature importance
- Compare model performance with visualizations

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset includes the following key features:

- `Tenure`
- `PreferredLoginDevice`
- `CityTier`
- `WarehouseToHome`
- `CashbackAmount`
- `Complain`, `SatisfactionScore`, `NumberOfAddress`, etc.
- `Churn` (Target variable)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📝 Conclusion
🔍 Built a complete Customer Churn Prediction system using supervised machine learning techniques.

🎯 Objective: To predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their behavioral and transactional data.

🧹 Performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.

🧠 Applied and compared multiple classification models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

🥇 Among all models, Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 96.36%.

📊 Conducted feature importance analysis to identify key factors affecting churn, which helps businesses target at-risk customers effectively.

💼 This model can assist marketing and CRM teams in implementing proactive retention strategies, reducing customer loss and improving revenue.
